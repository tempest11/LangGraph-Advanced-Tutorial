# Usage Stats Collection

LMCache collects anonymous usage data by default to help the engineering team understand real-world workloads, prioritize optimizations, and improve reliability. All collected data is aggregated and contains no sensitive user information.

A sanitized subset of the aggregated data may be publicly released for the community’s benefit (for example, see a daily usage report `here <https://github.com/Hanchenli/OSS_Growth_Toolkit/tree/main/usage_tracker/report>`_).

## What data is collected?

Usage stats are emitted as three message types, implemented in `usage_context.py`:

- **EnvMessage**  
  Captures environment details such as cloud provider, CPU info, total memory, architecture, GPU count/type, and execution source.  

- **EngineMessage**  
  Records engine configuration and metadata, including cache settings (chunk size, local device, cache limits), remote backend parameters, blending settings, model name, world size, and KV-cache dtype/shape.  

- **MetadataMessage**  
  Reports execution metadata: the timestamp when the run started and total duration in seconds.

These messages are serialized to JSON and POSTed to the LMCache usage server.

### Example JSON payload

``json
{
  "message_type": "EnvMessage",
  "provider": "GCP",
  "num_cpu": 24,
  "cpu_type": "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz",
  "cpu_family_model_stepping": "6,85,7",
  "total_memory": 101261135872,
  "architecture": ["64bit", "ELF"],
  "platforms": "Linux-5.10.0-28-cloud-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.31",
  "gpu_count": 2,
  "gpu_type": "NVIDIA L4",
  "gpu_memory_per_device": 23580639232,
  "source": "DOCKER"
}
``

## Previewing collected data

If you enable **local logging**, usage messages are appended to your specified log file. To inspect the most recent entries:

``bash
tail ~/.config/lmcache/usage.log
``

## Configuration & Opt-out

By default, usage tracking is **enabled**. To disable all usage stats collection, set the environment variable:

``bash
export LMCACHE_TRACK_USAGE=false
``

When `LMCACHE_TRACK_USAGE` is set to `false`, `InitializeUsageContext` will return `None` and no data will be sent or logged.

### Local logging

If you would like to log to a file in addition to (or instead of) sending data to the server, pass a local-log path when initializing:

``python
from lmcache.usage_context import InitializeUsageContext
``

   usage_ctx = InitializeUsageContext(
       config=engine_config,
       metadata=engine_metadata,
       local_log="~/.config/lmcache/usage.log"
   )

Omitting the `local_log` argument (or passing `None`) disables local file logging.
