# Example: Multimodal KV Cache Support

### Quick Start Example (Audio Model): 

We  going to be running audio inference with `ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b` and using LMCache to speed up the TTFT after the first request.

**Install and Serve:** 

`pip install lmcache vllm[audio] openai`

``bash
vllm serve fixie-ai/ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b \
 --max-model-len 4096 --trust-remote-code \
 --kv-transfer-config '{"kv_connector":"LMCacheConnectorV1","kv_role":"kv_both"}'
``

**Benchmark:** 

Save as `audio_query.py`
