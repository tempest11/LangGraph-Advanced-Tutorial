## Overview

This document explains the principle, benefits, differences from vLLM PR `19330 <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/19330>`_, and limitations of the LMCache `async_loading` feature.
It focuses on LMCache v1 integration with vLLM and the internal storage pipeline.

Key change of components in this feature include:

- LMCache async lookup client/server (ZMQ-based)
- Storage manager orchestrating backends and concurrency
- Cache engine async API entrypoints
- vLLM adapter integration points

## Principle and Theory

At a high level, `async_loading` decouples scheduler-side lookup from worker-side prefetch/retrieval, allowing overlap between I/O and computation while preserving prefix-based correctness.

- The scheduler sends lookup requests with token chunk hashes and offsets.
- Worker-side servers perform tiered `batched_async_contains` over available backends and eagerly launch non-blocking batched get operations for hit prefixes.
- Completion is tracked via an `EventManager` to safely deliver loaded memory objects back to the requesting path.
- A weighted semaphore with an `AsyncSerializer` prevents allocator deadlocks by shaping concurrency according to chunk budget.

The following Mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the end-to-end flow:

     participant EM as EventManager

     end

## Benefits

- Performance overlap
    - **I/O–Compute Overlap**: Decoupling lookup/prefetch from loading enables fetching KV chunks while vLLM continues scheduling/computation.
- Robustness and error handling
    - **Event-driven Synchronization**: `EventManager` ensures safe hand-off of futures and avoids race conditions between threads and the async loop.
    - **Backpressure & Deadlock Avoidance**: `AsyncSerializer` with a weighted semaphore caps concurrent chunk retrievals based on allocator budget, preventing starvation or allocator lockups.
    - **Graceful Miss Path**: Immediate response with `None` hit tokens when nothing is retrievable; worker returns quickly without stalling the scheduler.

## Comparison with vLLM Load Failure Recovery feature

The `VLLM_PR_19330 <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/19330>`_ introduces a fault recovery mechanism for vLLM's KV connector infrastructure that enables graceful handling of KV cache load failures by automatically detecting failed block loads and rescheduling only affected requests for recomputation from a valid prefix.
By contrast, LMCache’s `async_loading` is an externalized caching layer with its own client/server, storage backends, and concurrency control.

## Limitations

- Only works with vllm merged `VLLM_PR_23620 <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/23620>`_
- Backend support constraint: This feature currently requires backends that implement `batched_async_contains`; limited to a few backends, e.g.:
    - `LocalCpuBackend`
    - `LocalDiskBackend`
    - `S3Connector`
    - `FSConnector`
    - `RedisConnector/RedisClusterConnector`
- save_unfull_chunk: Automatically disabled in async mode for correctness in prefix chunking.

## Future Work

- Introduce a default `batched_async_contains` implementation, so all backends can support `async_loading`.
- Refactor `AsyncSerializer` to support being enabled together with `save_unfull_chunk` and `PDBackend`.
- Add metrics and observability to track the number of asynchronous lookup requests and the number of occupied `MemoryObj` instances.
- Improve the lookup framework by passing vLLM prefix cache hit tokens so that async lookup can skip loading parts already hit in vLLM.
