# Using Different Caching Policies

LMCache supports multiple caching policies.

For example, to use LRU, you can set the environment variable `LMCACHE_CACHE_POLICY=LRU` or set it in the configuration file with `cache_policy="LRU"`.

Currently, LMCache supports "LRU" (Least Recently Used), "MRU" (Most Recently Used), "LFU" (Least Frequently Used) and "FIFO" (First-In-First-Out) caching policies.
